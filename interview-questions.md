# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git is the software where everything is done and  github is the everything is uploaded like a cloud and where work can be collaberated. 

  Researched answer: I  was a in a snese correct, but not fully. So I found more that git is on your local computer and can be downloaded for free. It is known for version controls whcih allow you got back in version of what you previously had in case soemthing got messsed up. it also allows for branches which allow you to create code for the code you have without having to mess up your code. It's like creating a testing  ground. Whereas github is where we upload al those branches and sources so that we can access it from anywhere as long as we have internet.  So instead of one person, you can have as many people as you want to working on the same coding project. Github makes it easier as well because it is a gui so you can see where thing are and what there are a lot easier.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: conditionals are the ones that return a boelean which is either true or false.

  Researched answer: so I guess I didn't explain it well. It's a conditional, but it can have eithe rexpressions(&&, ||, ex). I also found out that you can use more than one when using parentheses correctly such as 

  const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase()) - src https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~matuszek/General/JavaSyntax/boolean-expressions.html

so if the condition you set meets a true or false, it means you used a boolean.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: let's say we have an array, index is where it is in the array starting from 0 to the amount of values you have in it so if you have 6 values, then the number will go up to 5 because it's 0-5 not 1-6. the value is what you would have in the array. as in how many strings, obj., ect are in the array.

  Researched answer: most things I researched said about the same things I said. A lot of them were just the coding. I searched a few websites and couldnt find much. in the syllabus it says that the content in the element is the value and index is its location.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: iteration is the when you use for(let) code I believe. It helps you loop a code till whatever it is you coded down is met, which is usually a number. I just used it last week, but I'm having a little trouble remembering mthe exact definition .

  Researched answer:I was correct! I doubted myself a little but I was mostly correct. I did however learn that there are different things you can add to the itteration thatn the things I have used so far such as Map() which is a little more complex, but it takes three arguments when yo use it like the item value, index, and array. I guess iteration has many ways to change a thing many times.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: usually there's a driver and a navigator. ONe person codes while the other leads the way of coding. Usually when I pair program and we have questions, depending on the amount we do a selected amount at a time so that we can both get experience. I also found it helpful if you both work on it together as well, so that your mindset isn't just, "youre gonna tell me what to do and i'll write it." If both have input and thoughts it's even better because soemtimes one doesn't know but the other does and you could be in either spot.It helps to communicate for sure. With frustration, of course it may happen but if you can put it [ast you adn take a little break then that's always good. Have you not seen the shining? "all work no play makes johnny a dull boy"

  Researched answer: I read an article which had a six step process for pair programming. Of course don't just take that in and say it's the only wasy but you can definitley learn some stuff from it. it had prepare, work closely together, leaern and help leaerning together, establish a rhythm, communicate, and accept changes. I think those are all helpful tips for it and I actually took some of that advice in myself.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: this accepts or returns another function. A function that goes higher than a function which is a little a confusing. I need a human to explain that to me.

2. Jest: jest is basically a way to test javascript but it was built by facebook. It is super fast and works in real time so you don't really have to wait. it supports a lot of strange inputs which I will learn about. 

3. Objects:  objects are the values within a variable but cam contain many values which is what make it an object. Like having many different properties, but dtill leading to the same spot and working all in the same code.

4. Method: A method is a way to add a function as on object to a function, so it can be used within the function as well.

5. Classes:n class is a way to have  a pre set up template for functions or objects. It helps construct new ways to get a set of things, such as time, day, year. it Must have the cunstroctormethod() in it.
 followed by the methods to take.
